1️⃣ Sequence-Based Models (For Predicting Next Actions Based on User History)
Since user interactions are time-sequenced, a model that learns patterns from past behaviors can predict the next action that maximizes engagement.
🔹 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) / Long Short-Term Memory (LSTMs) / Transformer-based Models
Can model sequential dependencies in user interactions.
Captures long-term dependencies in user behavior.
Example: Given a user’s event history (page_view → button_click → form_submit), predict the next event before they drop off.
Could be implemented using LSTM, GRU, or Transformers (BERT-like model for sequences).
🔹 Markov Chains / Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
Models user navigation as a probabilistic sequence.
Example: If 80% of users who visit Page A next go to Page B, then recommend Page B dynamically.
Works well for short-term next-action prediction but not long-term dependencies.
🔹 Sequence-to-Sequence Models (Seq2Seq)
Given a sequence of user events, generate the next best event recommendation.
Similar to machine translation, but instead of translating sentences, you’re predicting next actions.




2️⃣ Reinforcement Learning (RL) (For Personalized Next-Action Recommendations)
Instead of just predicting what users will do next, RL can optimize user engagement by recommending the best action.
🔹 Deep Q-Networks (DQN) / Policy Gradient RL
Learns optimal actions (e.g., showing a notification, redirecting to a feature) to increase engagement.
The reward function could be session duration, click-through rate, or feature adoption.
Example: If a user is about to leave (session_end detected), suggest an action (e.g., pop up a feature recommendation, guide to another page).
🔹 Multi-Armed Bandits (MAB)
If real-time recommendations are needed, MAB can dynamically suggest features based on their success rate.
Example: If users who see "Feature X" stay longer, the model learns to suggest Feature X more often.




3️⃣ Graph-Based Models (For Understanding User Navigation & High-Value Actions)
User interactions can be represented as a graph, where:
Nodes = Actions (e.g., "viewed_quote", "clicked_risk_report")
Edges = Transitions between actions
🔹 Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
Learns high-value interactions that lead to increased engagement.
Can recommend actions that move users towards high-engagement paths.
Example: If users who interact with Page A → Feature B stay longer, recommend Feature B to new users.
🔹 PageRank for User Actions
Identifies most influential actions in keeping users engaged.
Example: If "risk_report_view" has a high PageRank, recommend it when engagement drops.




4️⃣ Causal Inference (For Understanding What Actions Increase Retention)
Instead of correlation, causal inference determines which actions actually cause higher engagement.
🔹 Uplift Modeling
Compares users who took an action vs. those who didn’t.
Example: Did clicking "View Risk Report" cause a longer session? If yes, recommend it dynamically.
🔹 Propensity Score Matching
Finds users with similar behaviors but different actions to analyze impact.
Example: Users who engaged with feature X vs. those who didn’t—did they stay longer?
5️⃣ Clustering (For Grouping Users with Similar Behaviors)
Before recommending actions, you can cluster users based on engagement patterns.





🔹 K-Means / DBSCAN / Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
Identifies user segments (e.g., power users vs. casual users).
Recommends actions tailored to each group.
Example: If power users always engage with Feature Y, suggest it to similar users.
🔹 Autoencoders for Anomaly Detection
Detects unusual user behavior (e.g., unexpected drop-off patterns).
Can trigger interventions before a user leaves.
Best Approach Given Your Data
✅ If you need real-time recommendations → Reinforcement Learning / MAB
✅ If user behavior is sequential → LSTMs / Transformers
✅ If you need to identify high-value actions → Graph-based models / Causal Inference
✅ If you want personalized recommendations → Clustering + Predictive Modeling





event_properties_type: The type of event (e.g., form submission, button click). This could be useful as different types might correlate with engagement. - 
event_properties_formId: If certain forms are associated with longer engagement, tracking form IDs over time might help.
event_properties_quoteName: Quotes might indicate specific tasks; sequence could show progression through quoting process.
event_properties_line-of-business and event_properties_lineOfBusiness: These might show the user's focus area, which could affect their journey.
event_properties_status: Success or failure status of actions; sequences of statuses could indicate friction points.
event_properties_error: Errors might lead to drop-offs; tracking error occurrences could help predict when interventions are needed.
event_properties_templateName: Using different templates might affect workflow efficiency.
event_properties_policyId and policy-id: Tracking policy interactions could be important for underwriters.
event_properties_hasAssignees and hasAccounts: Boolean flags indicating collaboration or account interactions, which might influence engagement.
event_properties_tableId and rowModel: If users interact with specific data tables, this could be part of their workflow sequence.
event_properties_messageId: Email or message interactions could be part of communication patterns.
user_properties_roles: Roles like underwriter vs admin might have different behavior patterns. However, since this is a static property, it's more useful as a feature rather than a sequence.
user_properties_businessUnit: Similar to roles, but again, static unless it changes over time, which is unlikely.
event_type: Already considered, similar to event_properties_action.
session_id: Grouping events into sessions could help, but the user is grouping by user_id across sessions.
device_type, os_name: Device and OS might influence behavior but are likely static or semi-static, so not part of a dynamic sequence.
city, country, region: Geographical data might be useful as contextual features but not as a time series sequence.
